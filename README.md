# My_1st_cpp_project_of_1st_semester
A simple C++ Student Management System project created during my 1st semester. It allows adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student records using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This project was developed to practice basic programming logic, functions, arrays, and file handling in C++.
